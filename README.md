## Projects

I have decided to impliment my repositories based around a ficticious organization to give them more meaning.
This organization has decided to invest heavily in Cloud Native Architecture and DEVOPS Tooling.
Due to the number of tools and pardadigms involved with building a robust Cloud and DEVOPS environmnet(s), everything
has been organized into their own github organization with their own project boards and relevant repositories.
For example, there are Organizations for a IAC Registry, Docker files, Tooling, and more!
