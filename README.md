# Hi there, I'm Joe

## I am a Cloud Infrastructure Engineer

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building my personal brand with youtube
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently always learning

### Projects

I have decided to impliment my repositories based around a ficticious organization to give them more meaning.
This organization has decided to invest heavily in Cloud Native Architecture and DEVOPS Tooling.
Due to the number of tools and pardadigms involved with building a robust Cloud and DEVOPS environmnet(s), everything
has been organized into their own github organization with their own project boards and relevant repositories.
For example, there are Organizations for a IAC Registry, Docker files, Tooling, and more!

**_[Terraform Registry](https://github.com/terraform-aws-iac)_**  
No devops invested infrastructure would be complete without its own standardized IAC Registry

**_[Devinitly Infrastructure](https://github.com/devinitly-infrastructure)_**  
You will find repositories for IAC managed AWS Accounts and Infrasructure here.

**_[Cloud Engineering](https://github.com/devinitly-infrastructure)_**  
Grouping of all Engineering solutuions and services for cloud environments.  
For example, Hardened AMI pipelines and AWS Account creation automation.
